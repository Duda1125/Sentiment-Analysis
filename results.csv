4,"I'm not from the area, I was visiting a friend and looking for somewhere to satisfy my wings craving. I used my trusted Yelp app to find this location (only 10 min from my friend's house, and on the way) and I am so happy I ended up at this stop.I walked in and was greeted immediately by a gentleman I presume to be the owner. I explained that it was my first visit and I'm not from the area. He asked me what was I craving and began to list their offerings while pointing to pictures and menus on the wall. There were so many options: fish, shrimp, chicken wings, chicken tenders, sides, dinners, combos, etc. I noticed all the displays upon arriving and was overwhelmed and after he threw some options, I narrowed the options to chicken wings. He explained I could do just wings or I could do a dinner and proceeded to share the prices and what's included. He expressed there was a special for the 8 piece and 10 piece wing dinner. I was sold. I'm sad that I don't live in the area, I got the 10 wing dinner, but I was only able to do 2 flavors (there are so many choices for those too!!!), I chose lemon pepper and garlic. He said about a 10Minute wait. Before I left he said thanks and included a menu and explained they cook everything fresh so if I call beforehand I won't have to wait. I wasn't bothered by the wait but it was so nice to be treated this way and to know the food was prepared just for me.Since I was doing the dinner I also got potato wedges, Cole slaw and a dinner roll. I got to my friend's house and was excited to eat because I smelled the food the whole ride over. It was delicious. So delicious, I forgot to snap a picture until I had gotten through 4 wings. The wings are decent size and whole wings, which is my favorite way to eat wings. No offense to other places, but pieces of wings are not as good as whole wings. Next time I visit I will stop in again. I'm bookmarking this spot and I will call ahead when I'm 10-15 minutes out so I don't have a long wait. I want to try their other flavors, but the flavors I had were delicious. I hope to bring my husband so he can get two flavors and I can get two more flavors, then I can try all 4 flavors. Great service, great flavor, great prices.","i'm not from the area, i was visiting a friend and looking for somewhere to satisfy my wings craving. i used my trusted yelp app to find this location
